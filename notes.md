## positioning

relative / absolute / fixed;

- > NOTE: relative: the element is positioned relative to its normal position. It can be shifted from its normal position using properties like top, left, right, or bottom.
- > NOTE: absolute: the element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an element with a position other than static). If there is no positioned ancestor, it is positioned relative to the document body. It can be placed anywhere in the document using properties like top, left, right, or bottom.
- > NOTE: fixed: the element is positioned relative to the browser window or viewport. It does not move when the page is scrolled. It can be placed anywhere in the viewport using properties like top, left, right, or bottom.
